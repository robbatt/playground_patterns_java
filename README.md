========================

Just a few basic code samples for using software patterns in java.

If not specified otherwise images and diagrams in the docs folder are taken from Wikipedia and will therefore have to stay under CC license I suppose.

Same applies for code that seems to be copied from Wikipedia. Any other code written and changed by me is under LGPL, so do what you want with it, I would be happy about feedback and ideas about improvements though :)

Happy Coding!
